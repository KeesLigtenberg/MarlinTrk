  ==== This is still Work in Progress =======


------------------------------------------------------------
 
Examples of how to use MarlinTrk can be found in:

https://svnsrv.desy.de/desy/marlinreco/MarlinTrkProcessors/trunk

specifically RefitProcessor which takes a track collection and refits each track.


 =============================================================================================================


  --------
 | v01-03 |
  -------- 

  	   - Added cylindrical SIT for LOI data.
	   - improve use of MarlinTrk namespace.
	   - Fixed use of covariance matrix in initialise. 
	   - Changed getSiteFromLCIOHit from taking an iterator to taking a pointer to a site. 
	   - Corrected smoothed state when used.


  --------
 | v01-02 |
  -------- 

  	   - To correctly determine the fits at the first hit and the last hit methods have be added to IMarlinTrk to 
             get the list of pointers to EVENT::TrackerHit and the chi2 increment for both hits included in the fit 
             as well as those rejected as outliers. 
	   - To test the chi2 increment which would result from adding a hit to the fit the method  testChi2Increment 
             has been added to IMarlinTrk. This method will not alter the fit, it simply provides a method to test 
             the inclusion of a hit. 
           - MarlinKalTestTrack has been adapted to use the pointer to LCIO TrackerHits in ILDVTrackHit.

  --------
 | v01-01 |
  -------- 

  	   - Support for KalDet Multilayer added
	   - Added calo face to support detector
	   - Made use of new method in  ILDVMeasLayer "getIntersectionAndCellID"
	   - Change GetMLName to GetName in line with KalTest
	   - Fixed phi range of helixtrack
  	   - MarlinKalTestTrack fixed definition of phi0 in  initialise(TS& ts)
	     corrected conversion from LCIO to KalTest track parameters in initialise

  IMarlinTrack:
	Interface for generic tracks in MarlinTrk. The interface should provide the functionality to perform track finding and fitting.   

  IMarlinTrkSystem:
	Base class for tracking system implementations in MarlinTrk.

  MarlinKalTestTrack:
	Tracking System used to create a KaltTest Kalman fitter - instantiates and holds the detector geometry. 

  LCIOTrackPropagators:
	Functions to perform the geometric propagation of LCIO tracks, for closed solutions.

  HelixFit:
	C++ rewrite of the aleph Fortran routine TFITHL, which provides a fast helix fit
